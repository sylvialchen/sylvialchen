#### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I started coding last year and I ***haven't been able to stop***. I enjoy breaking down concepts into clear, well-thought out objects (models, components, or entities), then puzzling solutions accordingly. I definitely love a good ERD, where corporate and people processes have been in my wheelhouse as a career switcher. I like a good challenge, but moreover, I love a good solution. I'm currently open to building products and features that can help you and your team(s)!
